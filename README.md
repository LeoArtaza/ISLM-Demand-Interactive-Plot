# ISLM Aggregate Demand Interactive Plot
This script lets you interact with the IS-LM variables for aggregate demand to see the equilibrium change in all the graphs of the model at the same time.
Additionally, parameters are set to reasonable real-life values so that the initial equilibrium starts at 5% interest rate with a 50k GDP per capita.
